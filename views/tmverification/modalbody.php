              <p>Ans: From Bank of Industry Contact center</p>
            <h5>Q6. Why should I give you my details?</h5>
              <p>Ans: Details are needed in other to verify your information earlier given to the enumerator to complete the processing of your loan.</p>
            <h5>Q7. Is there interest on TraderMoni?</h5>
              <p>Ans: NO. TraderMoni is has no interest! The only charge on TraderMoni is a 2.5% admin charge to support some of the payments to the people registering and capturing you. So, if you take N10,000, you will pay back only N10,250.</p>
